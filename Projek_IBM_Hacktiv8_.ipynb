It's not merely annoying or a minor inconvenience; it's a critical failure that prevents normal game progression until external intervention (round end). This severity level acknowledges the frustration and loss of time experienced by the player, along with the potential for unbalancing the competitive integrity of the match.\n",

When players cannot plant the spike due to a bug, it creates an unfair disadvantage, as the attackers are unable to progress to the next stage of the round. This directly affects gameplay balance and can significantly influence match outcomes. While it doesn't render the game unplayable (Game-Breaking Bug) or provide an unfair advantage (Exploit Bug), it does unjustly hinder a player's ability to perform a fundamental action, thus classifying it as a Player-Disadvantage Bug.\n",
